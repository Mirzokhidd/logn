#basic idea: If you sing up, it creates a file with your username ( and the password has some rules to follow). When logging in, if the same file exists 
# with the username given, it compares the data inside to the username and password. If it matches it lets you in if not than doesnt 


#the login page

    print("\nLogin: \n")
    username = input("Your Username: ")
    password = input("Your Password: ")

    if username and password in open(username + ".txt").read(): #compare the inputed username and passowrd to a file with the the same username
        print("It is correct. Welcome\n")
    else: 
        print("Wrong username or password. Try again\n")
        login()

        print("\nOhh that account already exists. Try signing in or create a new account\n")
